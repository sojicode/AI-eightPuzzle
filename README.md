### AI_Eight Puzzle
A sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.
The puzzle also exists in other sizes. If the size is 4Ã—4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle.
The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order (see diagram) by making sliding moves that use the empty space.
